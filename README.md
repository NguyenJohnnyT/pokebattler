## Description
Gotta Catch 'Em All! We created a turn-based game called Poke Battler. To start battling, choose your starter pokemon: Bulbasaur, Squirtle, or Charmander. Defeat monsters on different levels to beat the game. We wanted to create a game where you can battle monsters from other fictional worlds--not just from the Pokemon world. The game utitlizes the Pokemon API to grab the sprite images of the pokemon. Make sure to not let your pokemon run out of hitpoints, or you will lose the game!
